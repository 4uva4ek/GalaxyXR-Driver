# GitHub Actions release build

The release workflow is `.github/workflows/release.yml`.

## Release version

The workflow verifies that the release version agrees across:

- `GalaxyXRDriver/src/Config/Config.cpp`
- `GalaxyXRDriver/DriverFiles/driver.vrdrivermanifest`
- `GalaxyXRDriverGUI/package.json`
- `GalaxyXRDriverGUI/package-lock.json`
- `GalaxyXRDriverGUI/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`
- `GalaxyXRDriverGUI/src-tauri/Cargo.toml`
- `GalaxyXRDriverGUI/src-tauri/Cargo.lock`

A tagged release must use exactly `v<version>`.

## Automatic release from main

Commit your changes and push them to `main`. CI chooses the next version from
commit subjects since the latest reachable stable release tag, updates all seven
version files above, and prepends an entry to `CHANGELOG.md`.

This project's rules use **patch** for fixes, **minor** for features, and **major** for reworks:

| Commit subject | Version change (starting at 1.2.4) |
| --- | --- |
| `fix: correct an issue` or `fix(gui): correct an issue` | `1.2.5` |
| `feat: add a feature` or `feat(gui): add a feature` | `1.3.0` |
| `rework: redesign a feature` or `rework(gui): redesign a feature` | `2.0.0` |
| Mixed prefixes in the unreleased commits | One bump at the highest level: `rework:` > `feat:` > `fix:` |
| Only `docs:`, `chore:`, or other subjects | Build and test; no release |

Squash merges use the squash commit's subject, so give it the appropriate prefix.
Normal merges retain the individual commit subjects; merge commits themselves are
excluded. Prefixes must be lowercase and followed by a space and a description.
An optional `!` is accepted but does not change these project-specific rules.

Generated entries group reworks, features, fixes, and other changes, include short commit
IDs, and preserve existing changelog history. Icon attribution stays in `CREDITS.md`
inside the ZIP and in the README; it is not appended to each release's notes.

After the full build, tests, packaging, and artifact upload succeed, CI pushes a
`chore(release): v...` commit containing only the version files and changelog,
then tags **that exact built commit** and publishes. Pull `main` before your next
push to receive this metadata commit. The workflow uses `GITHUB_TOKEN` with
`contents: write`; its push does not start another Actions run
([GitHub's token-trigger rules](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/choose-when-workflows-run/trigger-a-workflow)).
If branch protection prevents the bot from pushing, publication fails rather
than bypassing protection.

If `main` advances while a build runs, that stale run does not overwrite it or
publish its prepared version. The next main run considers all unreleased commits.
Reruns recreate the same metadata commit; interrupted publication can reuse it.

Manual version overrides remain available, including patch and prerelease versions:

```powershell
node bump-version.js 1.2.5
node tools/verify-release-version.cjs
```

Commit all seven version files. CI respects an explicitly changed version and
generates its changelog entry if missing. Existing authored entries are retained.
For a repository with no stable release tag, CI uses the push's base commit;
if neither is available, create an initial stable `v<version>` tag first.
Feature branches and pull requests build and test without changing versions or
publishing. Local builds never generate release commits or push anything.

The Windows workflow:

1. checks out the full repository and recursive submodules;
2. installs Node.js, prepares automatic metadata, installs Rust and locates MSBuild;
3. verifies all release version fields (and the tag on tag-triggered runs);
4. runs `npm ci` and the frontend test suite;
5. runs `node build.js --vendor neutral` and `node build.js --vendor galaxyxr`, each building the native OpenVR driver and Tauri application, then runs the Rust library tests;
6. validates the staged executable, driver DLL, manifest and default settings;
7. packages the complete Galaxy XR portable pair into `GalaxyXRDriver-v<version>-Windows-x64.zip`;
8. creates a SHA-256 checksum;
9. generates release notes from the version's changelog entry without duplicating its commit list;
10. uploads the ZIP and metadata as Actions artifacts; and
11. saves generated metadata to `main`, pins `v<version>` to the built commit, uploads the ZIP and checksum to a draft, and publishes after both uploads succeed. Prerelease versions are marked as prereleases.

A manual **Run workflow** invocation builds without publishing by default. To retry
a failed publication, select **main** and enable **publish**. Reruns preserve an
already published release and never move an existing tag to a different commit;
after code changes, use a `fix:`/`feat:`/`rework:` commit or an explicit new version.
Explicit `v*` tag pushes remain supported and build the tagged files without rewriting them.

`build-tools.yml` separately installs the locked frontend dependencies and runs
the service regressions plus build-tool tests under PowerShell 5.1 and 7.

The local full build command is unchanged and never publishes or deploys:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools/Build-Portable.ps1
```
